| noncurrent\_version\_transition\_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the glacier tier infrequent access tier | `number` | `30` | no |
| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan.
